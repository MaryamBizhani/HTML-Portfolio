<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I hold a PhD in experimental condensed matter physics from Ohio University, where I worked as a research assistant in an advanced optical laboratory.
I am an intellectually curious individual who is passionate about science.</p>

<p>Recently, I've developed a strong interest in coding and computational tools, driven by a desire to deepen my problem-solving skills and explore new ways to analyze data. I enjoy teaching myself new programming languages and frameworks, and Iâ€™m excited by how coding opens up creative approaches to scientific challenges.</p>
